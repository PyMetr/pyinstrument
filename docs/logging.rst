Logging in Python Projects
==========================

Logging is an essential aspect of software development, allowing developers to track events, diagnose issues, and understand software behavior. The Python ``logging`` module offers a versatile way to log messages at various severity levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.

Setting Up Logging
------------------

Proper setup is crucial for effective logging. Use ``logging.basicConfig()`` at the application's entry point to configure global logging behavior:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                        format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s')

Logger Hierarchy and Effective Level
------------------------------------

Python's logging system is hierarchical. Loggers can inherit settings from their parents, up to the root logger. The effective level of a logger is determined by its level and its ancestors.

Creating and Using Loggers
--------------------------

In each module, create a logger using the module's name. This approach facilitates tracking where a log message originated:

.. code-block:: python

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

Logging messages at various levels:

.. code-block:: python

    logger.debug("This is a debug message")
    logger.info("This is an informational message")
    logger.warning("This is a warning message")
    logger.error("This is an error message")
    logger.critical("This is a critical message")

Logging Best Practices
----------------------

1. **Appropriate Level**: Choose the right level for each message. Use DEBUG for detailed diagnostic information, INFO for general events, WARNING for unexpected but non-critical events, ERROR for serious issues, and CRITICAL for severe conditions that might require immediate attention.

2. **Contextual Information**: Include context in your log messages to make them more informative. This can include relevant data like user IDs, transaction IDs, or state information.

3. **Structured Logging**: Consider using structured logging for complex applications. This involves logging messages in a structured format, like JSON, making it easier to query and analyze logs.

4. **Log Rotation and Management**: Use handlers for log rotation to avoid consuming excessive disk space. Python's ``logging.handlers`` module provides tools for managing log files, such as ``RotatingFileHandler``.

5. **Security and Privacy**: Be mindful of sensitive information. Avoid logging sensitive data like passwords or personal information.

6. **Performance Considerations**: Logging can impact performance. Use lazy formatting to avoid unnecessary computation when the log level is set to ignore the message.

.. code-block:: python

    logger.debug("Processed %s records", num_records)  # Lazy formatting
