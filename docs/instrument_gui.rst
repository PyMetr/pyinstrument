Dynamic GUI Generation from Instrument Models
=============================================

The magic of ``pymetr`` doesn't stop at simplifying direct device communication; it takes things up a notch by offering dynamic GUI generation capabilities. With this slick feature, you can parse instrument models and automagically conjure up a property command tree that's in lockstep with the instrument's state. Now that's what we call lit!

Creating a Live Link Between GUI and Instrument
-----------------------------------------------

Ever got tired of the tedious task of aligning your GUI elements with your instrument's properties manually? Forget all that jazz. ``pymetr``'s GUI factory is your new best friend, handling all the heavy lifting for you, real-time.

Let's break it down:

1. **Parse Like a Boss**: The GUI factory reads through your instrument model files and identifies all properties defined using `switch_property`, `select_property`, and `value_property`.

2. **Build That Tree**: Using the gathered info, it builds a property tree where each node corresponds to an instrument property. Each tree node is ready to show off in the GUI and is already hooked up to the corresponding instrument command.

3. **Sync It Like You Mean It**: As you interact with the GUI, changes are instantly reflected in the instrument, and vice versa. Adjust a setting in the GUI, and the instrument responds right away. Query the instrument for its current state, and the GUI updates in a snap.

Here's a snippet to get the vibe:

.. code-block:: python

    # In your main GUI application file

    from pymetr.gui import DynamicInstrumentGUI
    from my_instrument_models import MyFancyOscilloscope

    # Spin up the application
    app = DynamicInstrumentGUI(model=MyFancyOscilloscope)
    app.show()

Now sit back, relax, and watch as your GUI magically springs to life, fully populated with all the controls and indicators you need to run the show.
